## Welcome to JiWoo‚Äôs Page üêà
Hello, I‚Äôm JiWoo Maeng.

I majored in System Control and minored in Data Software during my undergraduate studies, where I developed a strong interest in solving real-world problems through data-driven approaches.

Starting in my second year, I worked as an undergraduate research for about three years, taking various courses in AI-based data analysis and modeling while participating in hands-on projects.

Some of my representative projects include:
* Social Welfare Transportation Support System Using Deep Learning(R-CNN)
* Development of an Enhanced Electric Power Demand Forecasting Model Using GRU Time Series Prediction and Reinforcement Learning

Through these experiences, I discovered a deep passion for analyzing and solving practical problems with data and artificial intelligence.

Currently, I am working as an intern at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information (KISTI), where I support research related to NLP and LLM.

I enjoy taking on new challenges and am always eager to learn and grow.
