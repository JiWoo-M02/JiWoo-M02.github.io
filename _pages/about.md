Welcome to JiWoo‚Äôs Page üêà‚Äç‚¨õ
Hello! I‚Äôm JiWoo Maeng.
I majored in System Control and minored in Data Software.

I am very interested in data analysis and modeling based on artificial intelligence.
While working as an intern at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information (KISTI), I have become fascinated by analyzing and solving real-world problems through data-driven approaches.

So far, I have worked on projects such as:

A traffic signal optimization system for vulnerable road users using the R-CNN algorithm

A power demand forecasting model utilizing GRU and reinforcement learning

I enjoy taking on new challenges and learning new things.
I am especially passionate about making the world a better place through AI and data science.
